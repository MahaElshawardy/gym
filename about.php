				<p>At THE GYM, we’re about real fitness. Our no-nonsense, results-driven culture was built on
					a history rooted in weightlifting culture. With our award-winning designs and culture,
					THE GYM has effortlessly became an internationally recognized brand known for its commitment to health, strength, and fitness.
					Today, we continue to be one of the most celebrated fitness brands in the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our team is heavily involved in our community and closely connected with local public services, outreach programs, and other local businesses.
					Our culture isn’t that of these corporate gyms. When you walk in the door you’re here to work, sweat, and burn. At THE GYM, great shape is an authentic passion,
					and we don’t back down from the challenge to push our bodies to levels constantly challenging our limits.
